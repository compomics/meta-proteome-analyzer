name: Abi system evasion by virus
def: "Viral protein that counteracts a host abortive infection system (Abi). Bacterial Abi systems are diverse and act as an antiviral defense that targets a crucial step of virus multiplication such as replication, transcription or translation. Activation of Abi systems in the bacterial host leads to viral infection abortion, but can also lead to bacterial cell death (cellular \"suicide\"). For example, some E.coli strains infected by bacteriophage T4 activate an anticodon nuclease which causes depletion of tRNA(Lys) and, consequently, abolition of T4 protein synthesis. However, this effect is counteracted by the repair of tRNA(Lys) in consecutive reactions catalyzed by the viral enzymes polynucleotide kinase and RNA ligase." []

Vertebrates can develop a broad and almost infinite repertoire of antigen-specific receptors, which allows vertebrates to recognize almost any potential pathogen or toxin and to mount antigen-specific responses to it. Two types of adaptive immunity systems have evolved in vertebrates in order to generate immune receptor diversity. The jawed vertebrates strategy uses the V(D)JC recombination to achieve combinatorial diversity of immunoglobulin-based B cell receptors and T cell receptors. The jawless vertebrate strategy uses the somatic rearrangements of variable leucine-rich cassettes in the variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs). The hallmarks of an adaptive immune system is the production of antigen-specific recognition receptor by somatic gene rearrangement. The long life of some antigen-primed cytotoxic lymphocytes and plasma cells provide protective memory to prevent reinvasion." []

Most viruses have developed specific proteins to prevent the establishment of an antiviral state. About half of all bacteria and most archaea have a CRISPR (clustered regularly interspersed short plaindromic repeats) system of adaptive immunity to exogenous DNA. CRISPRs clusters are tandem arrays of alternating repeats and spacers, where the spacers in some cases are homologous to sequences from virus and plasmid genomes. The CRISPR arrays are transcribed, processed and in some way aid in detection and resistance to foreign DNA. In at least a few bacteria (E.coli, S.epidermidis) it seems DNA is the target, whereas in Pyrococcus furiosis it seems the CRISPR system targets RNA." []

Patients with Bartter syndrome are often critically ill from birth onwards, and their long-term clinical course may be complicated by nephrocalcinosis, leading to renal failure. Clinical disease results from defective renal reabsorption of sodium chloride in the thick ascending limb (TAL) of the Henle loop, where only 30% of filtered salt is normally reabsorbed." []

The less severe form features facial dysmorphia characterized by ocular hypertelorism, defects of the upper lip and/or nose, and absence of the olfactory nerves or corpus callosum.

def: "Protein involved in innate immunity, an inborn defense mechanism used by organisms to defend themselves against invasion by pathogens (bacteria, fungi, viruses, etc.). Initially discovered in insects which are devoid of an adaptive immune system and rely only on innate immune reactions for their defense, this immediate response accomplishes many activities including recognition and effector functions. Recognition is mediated by broad specificity, pattern recognition, receptors which recognize many related molecular structures (e.g. polysaccharides, polynucleotides) present in microorganisms but not found in the host. The innate responses include the release of antimicrobial peptides, production of cytokines, acute-phase proteins, complement. Although many different innate immune mechanisms are deployed for host defence, a unifying theme of innate immunity is the use of germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors for pathogens or damaged self components, such as the Toll-like receptors, nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like RNA helicases and C-type lectin receptors."

The carboxyl group of the muramic acid is commonly substituted by a peptide containing residues of both L- and D-amino acids, whereas that of L-talosaminuronic acid is substituted by a peptide consisting of L-amino acids only. These peptide units may be cross-linked by a peptide bond, thereby giving rise to a giant macromolecule that forms the rigid cell wall (sacculus or murein sacculus). This macromolecule is known to occur as a monomolecular layer between the inner and outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria and as a multimolecular layer, often associated covalently or non-covalently with various additional compounds (teichoic acids, neutral polysaccharides. etc.) in Gram-positive bacteria.

These processes include the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA by either RNA interference (RNAi) or endogenously encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) and the transcriptional regulation of mRNA by RNAi-mediated chromatin silencing. RNAi is generally triggered by the presence of dsRNA produced by bidirectional transcription or by the transcription of an inverted repeat or hairpin sequence. dsRNA is processed into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of around 21 nucleotide which are then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which cleaves mRNAs with sequences fully complementary to the siRNA. miRNAs differ from siRNAs principally in their biogenesis. miRNA genes encode precursors with complex hairpin structures which are processed by endonucleolytic cleavage to form mature miRNAs. Like siRNAs, miRNAs function in RISC-like complexes. Animal miRNAs generally inhibit translation of target mRNAs following imperfect base pairing to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), while most plant miRNAs show nearly precise complementarity to coding regions of target mRNAs and trigger mRNA degradation similar to siRNAs. Finally, in RNAi-mediated chromatin silencing, siRNAs derived from repeat element transcripts are incorporated into the nuclear RNAi-induced initiator of transcriptional silencing complex (RITS), where they guide chromatin modifications such as histone methylation which lead to transcriptional silencing."

Voltage-gated sodium channels, by opening in response to membrane depolarization, allow sodium entry and thus the propagation of depolarization along the plasma membrane of nerve, muscle and other electrically excitable cells. They play a role in different processes such as sensation, emotions, thought and movement.

Upon receptor binding, proteins located inside the capsid (head) rearrange to extend the tail tube, creating a channel spanning the periplasmic space. This hydrophilic channel directs the viral genome, and possibly some specific proteins, into the cytoplasm and protects it from periplasmic nucleases. Once the viral genome is in the host cytoplasm, the channel collapses and seals. Bacteriophage T7 for example expresses ejection proteins that partition into the host outer and cytoplasmic membranes and allow transport of viral DNA across the host envelope. Proteins of the ejection apparatus can play an active or a structural role in ejection." []
